I've been working on a food kiosk system built with Next.js, a React framework that supports both client-side and server-side rendering. This project includes features such as a real-time order management system, where users can place orders, view item totals, and track order status from creation to completion. The system utilizes Prisma for database interactions and offers functionalities like product management, search, validation, and integration with Cloudinary for image uploads. The kiosk interface supports order tracking, status updates, and management of product inventories, providing a seamless experience for both customers and kitchen staff. The project showcases the capabilities of Next.js with the latest version and router features, and it demonstrates robust client and server-side operations.
