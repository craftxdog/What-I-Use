I've been working on a task and project manager built with TypeScript for both front and back end, which you can check out here: [Frontend Repo](https://github.com/craftxdog/UptaskManagerFrontend) and [Backend Repo](https://github.com/craftxdog/UptaskManagerBackend). It includes features like user authentication, account registration, password reset, email confirmation with token validation, and role management (e.g., manager and collaborator). Managers can create, edit, and delete projects and tasks, while collaborators can update task statuses and add notes. The app features project validation, real-time task updates, and a drag-and-drop interface for task management. Built with React, React Query, and Tailwind CSS, it also has security features like token expiration, password confirmation for destructive actions, and role-based access control. Take care of your project management!. <a href="https://uptaskmanager.vercel.app"
